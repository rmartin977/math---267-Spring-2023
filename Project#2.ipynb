    "In simplest terms a Dynamical System is a point moving in space. We call this space a phase space\n",
    "and the path for the point a trajectory or orbit. The point could represent an actual particle that is moving in physical space or it could represent the instantaneous state of our Dynamical System. The trajectory thus illustrates how the system evolves with time. The evolution follows a vector field. The trajectories could be fixed points, spirals, closed loops that represent periodic behavior or the trajectory could be a chaotic orbit. In project #4 we will study chaotic orbits. In this project we investigate the predator-prey system an example of a Dynamical System. For the predator-prey system a point the phase space (the xy plane) represents the current population of the foxes and rabbits. \n",
